# correctorLSTM (cLSTM)
This repository includes corrector LSTM (cLSTM) with a running example on NAB. 
cLSTM is a machine learning algorithm with read and write priviledges. The algorithm operates in two modes: Learning and Correction. The learning mode corresponds to a standard LSTM. At the end of a given epoch, the correction mode is triggered. The latter has two stages: detection and correction.
The algorithm continue the learning after its corrections are done.
